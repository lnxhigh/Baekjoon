### 문제 설명

<p>Valentine has decided to congratulate all of his N girlfriends by giving each one a yellow rose. In the nearby flower market yellow roses are sold by exactly two vendors. Each of them has an unlimited amount of roses; however, they sell roses only in bouquets (so you can only buy a certain amount of roses at a time). At the first vendor you can buy a bouquet of A roses for B Euros; at the second vendor – a bouquet of C roses for D Euros. A, B, C, and D are all positive integers. If Valentine can buy more than N roses for a smaller amount of money than buying precisely N roses, he will buy more than N roses and gift the leftover to any of the two lovely  salesgirls. </p>

<p>Write a program that calculates the minimum amount of money in Euros for which Valentine can buy at least N roses! </p>
