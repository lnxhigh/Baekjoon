### 문제 설명

<p>Mirko has recently been visited by extraterrestrials from planet X3, where everyone’s name is a positive integer. All residents of the planet know each other. Two X3-ians calculate the strength of their friendship by converting their names to binary, aligning them one under the other, and writing a digit in each column: 0 if the two binary digits in that column are equal, 1 if they differ. The binary result is then converted back to the decimal system. </p>

<p>For example, the friendship value of 19 and 10 equals 25:</p>

<pre style="text-align: center;">1 0 0 1 1 = 19
0 1 0 1 0 = 10
--------------
1 1 0 0 1 = 25
</pre>

<p>The value of a planet in the Universe is defined as the sum of all friendship values. Mirko has asked you to help him compute the value of planet X3! </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the positive integer N (the number of residents of planet X3, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1 000 000). The next N lines contain the names of residents - positive integers smaller than 1 000 000, one per line. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output must contain the value of planet X3. </p>

<p> </p>
