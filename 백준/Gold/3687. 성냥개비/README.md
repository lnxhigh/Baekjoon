### 문제 설명

<p>Matchsticks are ideal tools to represent numbers. A common way to represent the ten decimal digits with matchsticks is the following:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.acmicpc.net/upload/images/match.png" style="height:88px; width:607px"></p>

<p>This is identical to how numbers are displayed on an ordinary alarm clock. With a given number of matchsticks you can generate a wide range of numbers. We are wondering what the smallest and largest numbers are that can be created by using all your matchsticks.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>On the ﬁrst line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100): the number of matchsticks you have.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Per testcase:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line with the smallest and largest numbers you can create, separated by a single space. Both numbers should be positive and contain no leading zeroes.</li>
</ul>
