### 문제 설명

<p>Given a number N, you are asked to count the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N. </p>

<p>Two integers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they have no common positive divisors other than 1 or, equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1. The number 1 is relatively prime to every integer. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line on input contains T (0 < T <= 100) the number of test cases, each of the next T lines contains three integers A, B, N where (1 <= A <= B <= 10<sup>15</sup>) and (1 <= N <= 10<sup>9</sup>). </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N. Follow the output format below. </p>
