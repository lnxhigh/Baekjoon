### 문제 설명

<p>By removing all digits left of the rightmost digit one in the binary representation of some integer, we get what is called the "zvrk" of that number. </p>

<p>For example, the zvrk of 6 i.e. (110)<sub>2</sub> is 2 i.e. (10)<sub>2</sub>, and the zvrk of 40 i.e. (101000)<sub>2</sub> is 8 i.e. (1000)<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>Write a program that will calculate the sum of the zvrks of all numbers between two given numbers A and B (inclusive). </p>

### 입력 

 <p>First and only line of input contains two integers A and B, 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10<sup>15</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>First and only line of output should contain the sum from the problem statement. </p>

<p>Note: the result will fit into the 64-bit signed integer type (int64 in Pascal, long long in C/C++).</p>
